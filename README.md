I have created a CMS system that allows a company to see there employees. 

It further specify it by departments, roles and salaries.

I used mySQL, Node.js and JS

In order to use this file you must install mysql, inquirer, console.table and then run it in a local server

You cam also add, remove and edit employee informations.
